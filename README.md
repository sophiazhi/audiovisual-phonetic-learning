# audiovisual-phonetic-learning

This is the code to reproduce the results in my master's thesis: "Unsupervised Phonetic Category Learning from Audio and Visual Input". 

To use this code, follow the commands in `pipeline_all.sh` while adjusting variables if needed.

Portions of this code are borrowed from [perceptual-tuning-pnas](https://github.com/Thomas-Schatz/perceptual-tuning-pnas).
